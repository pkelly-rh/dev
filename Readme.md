# Quick install
run this from this directory
```bash
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh && source ~/.zshrc
```
Now you have the "dev" alisa


# Installation

1. Make sh executable
`chmod +x install.sh`
2. Run installer
`./install.sh`
3. Reload zshrc file
`source ~/.zshrc`

What this will do:
It will copy the contents of src/dev.sh and append it to the bottom of your ~/.zshrc file
